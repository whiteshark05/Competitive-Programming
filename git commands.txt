Command Line is better to begin learning first.

To start, you only really need to know this to push:

git add . ( To add all your changes )

git commit -m ‘your message’ ( To commit those changes locally )

git push -u origin master ( To push your commits to your git server - eg. Github )

And this to pull commits from your server:

git pull origin master

To set your remote url to your git url:

git remote add origin your-github-url.git
OR
git remote set-url origin change-your-origin-to-another-url.git

To initialise a git repo locally:

git init

To clone a repo:

git clone your-git-repo.git your-local-directory
